## Example code and testing snippets

Various FIRRTL and occasionally MLIR examples of FIRRTL 2.0's references
for demonstrating their use and testing implementation.

All ref-type code snippets in the FIRRTL 2.0 specification are in the `spec` subdirectory.

Many of these, will be found in CIRCT in the form of lit tests as implementation progresses.
